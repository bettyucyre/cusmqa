# How to Get Unbanned on SCUM (2025 Guide) 🦌

Getting banned from SCUM can be a total bummer, especially when you think you’re just out there surviving like a pro! 😤 Don’t panic — this quick and cheeky guide will help you figure out why you got banned and show you exactly how to appeal to get back to your wild adventures in no time.

## Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️

Did your ban magically follow you to your brand-new SCUM account? Or does every new character get booted the second you spawn? Uh oh, you might be **HWID banned** (Hardware ID Ban)! This means SCUM knows your rig’s fingerprint and has slapped a ban on your hardware — pretty hardcore stuff that blocks you from playing even if you start fresh.

## Step 1: Understand Why You Were Banned ❓

Check your email inbox/spam for messages from SCUM or the game’s support team explaining what went down. Usual suspects for bans include:
- Cheating, hacks, or running third-party software to get an unfair advantage
- Toxic or abusive behaviors in chat or gameplay
- Sharing accounts or suspicious activities triggering their radar

**Pro tip:** Give the SCUM Terms of Service a quick skim before firing off your appeal.

## Step 2: Collect Your Information 📝

Before you beg for mercy, gather this stuff:
- Your SCUM (or related platform) account email address  
- Your SCUM username / in-game ID  
- The date and time your ban hit your account  
- Any screenshots, error codes, or ban messages
